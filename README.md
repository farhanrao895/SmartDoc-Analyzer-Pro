# SmartDoc Analyzer Pro 4.0

**SmartDoc Analyzer Pro 4.0** is an enterprise-grade **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application for analyzing large collections of construction and engineering documents such as **Minutes of Meetings (MOMs), QA/QC records, progress reports, RFIs, NCRs, specifications, and spreadsheets**.

The system is optimized for **accuracy, traceability, and scalability**, with **OCR support**, **hybrid retrieval**, and **inline source citations**.

---

## Key Features

### Advanced Hybrid Retrieval
- Semantic search (FAISS + embeddings)
- Keyword search (BM25)
- Multi-query expansion
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for best-of-both-worlds retrieval

### Document Intelligence
- Native PDF parsing (text-based PDFs)
- OCR support for scanned and mixed PDFs
- Excel / CSV ingestion with structured row extraction
- Automatic document classification:
  - QA/QC MOM
  - Progress Meeting (PGM)
  - RFI / NCR
  - Reports, Specifications, Letters, Drawings

### Expert-Level RAG
- Strict document-grounded answers
- Partial-answer handling (never fails silently)
- Multi-document aggregation for list-type questions
- Domain-aware prompts (construction & contracts)

### Inline Citations (Source-Aware Answers)
- Clickable citation badges `[1], [2], [3]`
- Source cards with:
  - File name
  - Page number
  - Meeting reference
  - Extracted chunk content
- Toggleable citation UI

### One-Time Knowledge Base Processing
- Pre-process documents once
- Persist FAISS indexes locally
- Instant runtime querying
- Cache validation using folder hashing

## Project Structure

.
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── knowledge_bases/ # Generated locally (NOT committed)



**Important:**  
`knowledge_bases/` contains indexed document data and must **never** be pushed to GitHub.

## Security & Data Safety

- No API keys are hard-coded
- API key is read from environment variables
- All document data stays local
- No uploads to external servers

### Required `.gitignore`

.env
.env.*

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-org/smartdoc-analyzer-pro.git](https://github.com/farhanrao895/SmartDoc-Analyzer-Pro/tree/main)
cd smartdoc-analyzer-pro


### 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


### 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Set environment variables
Create a `.env` file (do **not** commit it):

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


---

## Run the Application

streamlit run app.py


---

## Using the App

### Create a Knowledge Base
1. Provide a folder path containing PDFs / Excel files
2. Click **Process & Save**
3. Documents are:
   - OCR-processed if needed
   - Chunked and embedded
   - Stored locally for reuse

### Ask Questions
- Who attended Quality Department meetings?
- List all contractor delays discussed
- Is there any EOT entitlement recorded?
- Summarize IFC Addendum 3 notes across meetings

Each answer includes **fully traceable sources**.

---

## Designed For

- Construction project teams
- QA/QC departments
- Claims & contract analysis
- Engineering management
- RAG research & experimentation

---

## Architectural Highlights

- Multi-query retrieval to reduce recall loss
- Hybrid scoring (semantic + lexical)
- RRF fusion instead of naïve merging
- Relaxed answerability logic (partial > empty)
- Chunk-level metadata preservation

---

## Limitations

- Knowledge bases are local to the machine
- Large datasets require sufficient RAM
- OCR accuracy depends on scan quality

---

## Roadmap (Optional)

- Role-based authentication
- Cloud deployment (GCP / Azure)
- Incremental KB updates
- Knowledge-graph-assisted retrieval
- Multi-KB routing
